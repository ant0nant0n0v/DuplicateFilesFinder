# Duplicate Files Finder
When you run it in a directory, it'll scan for duplicates in that directory and all of its subdirectories, print the names of duplicate files, and move them to a "duplicates" subfolder. If there's a naming conflict in the "duplicates" folder, the script appends a number to the duplicate file's name.
